# iris_flower_Classification
This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools

The dataset was split into training set (75%) and test set (25%). The dataset is shuffled before splitting in order to eliminate the possibility of any initial structure in the dataset.Currently, it predicts it with an accuracy of 97%.

I'm using the KNeighborsClassifier Algorithm here which I directly imported from SciKit Learn module in Python.
